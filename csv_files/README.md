# There was an error in the code, so I had to manually edit Tristen Newton and Cam Spencer's csv to set NAT_CH = True, couldn't get the code to work otherwise. I'm pretty certain the issue is because they didn't play at UConn their whole career.

Rookies Folder contains college stats (or international league stats) of each rookie. Named by Draft Pick, so for example 3.csv is Reed Sheppard, since he was taken with the 3rd pick.
Winners Folder contains college stats (or international league stats) of each ROTY winner from the past 30 years.
Rookie_Names.csv and ROTY_Winners_Names have web scraped data of each players name.


Rookies Preprocessing and Winners Preproccessing contain stats as taken from  https://www.sports-reference.com and https://www.basketball-reference.com, before they are run through the processing Jupyter files
