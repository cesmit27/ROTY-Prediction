# ROTY-Prediction
Uses college stats of past ROTY Winners in the NBA to predict who will win the award for the 2024/25 season using euclidean distance.


prediction.py and Predicted_ROTY_Winner.csv are the main pieces here, everything else is for holding the stats and names of the players for use by prediction.py. The jupyter notebook files were used to clean up CSV files, web scrape names, draft pick number, etc of these players.
