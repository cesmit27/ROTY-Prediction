Rookies Folder contains college stats (or international league stats) of each rookie. Named by Draft Pick, so for example 3.csv is Reed Sheppard, since he was taken with the 3rd pick.
Winners Folder contains college stats (or international league stats) of each ROTY winner from the past 30 years.
Rookie_Names.csv and ROTY_Winners_Names have web scraped data of each players name.
